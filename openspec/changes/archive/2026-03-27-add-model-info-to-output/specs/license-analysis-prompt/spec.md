## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: License analysis prompt output begins with a model metadata block
The prompt template SHALL instruct the model to begin its response with a fenced YAML code block containing provenance metadata, so that saved response files are self-documenting.

The metadata block SHALL contain exactly three fields:
- `model` — the AI model's name and version as reported by the model itself
- `date` — the session date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `prompt` — the name of the prompt template used (`license-analysis`)

The metadata block SHALL appear before any other content in the response.

#### Scenario: Response is saved as a file and opened later
- **WHEN** a researcher opens a saved license analysis response file
- **THEN** the first visible element is the metadata block identifying the model, date, and prompt template

#### Scenario: Model self-reports its name and version
- **WHEN** the prompt instructs the model to fill in the `model` field
- **THEN** the model populates the field with its own name and version to the best of its ability
