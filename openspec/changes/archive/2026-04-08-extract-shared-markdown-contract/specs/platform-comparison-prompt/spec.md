## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Comparison prompt enforces agent-agnostic output structure

The prompt template SHALL include a concrete example of the per-platform profile structure so any agent can reproduce the exact shape mechanically. The prompt SHALL comply with the shared Markdown contract defined in `prompt-markdown-format`.

In addition to that shared contract, the prompt SHALL specify:

- **Profile heading level:** every platform profile SHALL use `###` as the top-level heading so profiles nest consistently under part headings
- **Score notation:** dimension scores SHALL always be written as `X/5` (e.g., `4/5`) — no other formats (`★★★★☆`, `4 out of 5`, `80%`, bold numbers) are permitted
- **Score placement:** in profiles, scores SHALL appear inline with the dimension label as `**Dimension (X/5):**` — e.g., `**Technical Architecture (4/5):**`
- **Score in table:** in the scoring table, score cells SHALL contain only the numeric value (e.g., `4`) with `?` for unknown — no `/5` suffix in table cells

The prompt SHALL include a concrete example profile for one fictional platform demonstrating the exact heading levels, field labels, score notation, and sources section structure.

#### Scenario: Two agents respond to the same prompt

- **WHEN** a researcher runs the comparison prompt on ChatGPT and on Claude
- **THEN** both responses use identical heading levels, field labels, and score notation — the only difference is the content

#### Scenario: Response is opened in a standard Markdown viewer

- **WHEN** a researcher saves the response as a `.md` file and opens it in GitHub, VS Code, Obsidian, or Typora
- **THEN** all formatting renders correctly with no raw syntax visible, no broken elements, and no AI-specific artifacts

#### Scenario: Model uses AI-specific citation format

- **WHEN** an AI model would normally respond with numeric bracket citations or footnotes
- **THEN** the prompt instruction overrides this and the model uses `[Description](https://...)` inline links instead
